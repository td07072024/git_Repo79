Left with little choice, the Burmese sued for peace. The Burmese king Bagyidaw sent a delegation, consisting of one American, one English and two Burmese ministers, to meet the commander of British forces, General Sir Archibald Campbell.[5] Final negotiations were not negotiations at all. The Burmese had to agree to all British demands.[citation needed]

The British demanded and the Burmese agreed to:[1][2]

Cede to the British Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Rakhine (Arakan), and Taninthayi (Tenasserim) coast south of Salween river,
Cease all interference in Cachar and Jaintia,
Pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling in four installments,
Allow for an exchange of diplomatic representatives between Ava and Calcutta,
Sign a commercial treaty in due course.
The first installment of indemnity was to be paid immediately, the second installment within the first 100 days from signing of the treaty, and the rest within two years. Until the second installment was paid, the British would not leave Yangon.[2]

The Treaty of Yandabo was signed by Gen. Campbell from the British side and Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side on 24 February 1826.[8] The Burmese paid 250,000 pounds sterling in gold and silver bullion as the first installment of the indemnity, and also released British prisoners of war.
